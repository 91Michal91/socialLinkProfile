# Social Links Profile

This project presents a sleek social links card, showcasing a front-end developer's profile with direct links to their social platforms. Built with HTML and CSS, it features a responsive design that adheres to modern web standards. The live version can be accessed on GitHub Pages. This challenge was taken up from Frontend Mentor to hone my HTML and CSS skills. For any contributions or questions, please reach out through the contact links on the profile.
